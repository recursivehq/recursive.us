          <h2>Build a Network.</h2>
          <p>Recursive members have access to a network of other freelance professionals. This means more than just having someone to talk to. It means more work opportunities. It means career advice and advancement. It means vacation support, so you can take precious time off. And yeah, it also means having people you can talk to. Going solo doesn't have to mean being alone.</p>
